# Notes:

### platformBrowserDynamic:
- platformBrowserDynamic is a function used to bootstrap an Angular application.
- contains the client side code that processes templates (bindings, components, ...) and reflective dependency injection.
- Using the dynamic platform makes angular sending the Just-in-Time compiler to the front-end as well as your application. Which means your application is being compiled on client-side.

### polyfills:
- Angular is built on the latest standards of the web platform. Targeting such a wide range of browsers is challenging because they do not support all features of modern browsers. You compensate by loading polyfill scripts ("polyfills") for the browsers that you must support.

### Interpolation "{{}}":
- Text interpolation lets you incorporate dynamic string values into your HTML templates.
- Use interpolation to dynamically change what appears in an application view.

### Just-in-Time:
- Larger file size
- Loads slower since compiler needs to run in browser.
- Catch errors in browser

### Ahead-of-Time:
- Small file size
- Loads faster since the app is compiled on delivery to the browser.
- Catch errors on the server
