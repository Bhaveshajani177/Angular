## Difference Between Reactive And Template Driven Forms

| Reactive Forms | Template-driven Forms |
|----------|-----------------|
| More control over validation logic | Good for simple forms |
| Good for complex forms | Simple validation |
| Unit testable | Easier to create and Less code |
|Handles any complex scenarios|Suitable for simple scenarios and fails for complex scenarios.|
|Easier unit testing|Unit testing is another challenge|
|while Reactive forms need the ReactiveFormsModule|Template Driven Forms need the FormsModule|
|while Reactive forms are defined programmatically at the level of the component class|Template Driven Forms are based only on template directives|
|Reactive Forms are a better default choice for new applications, as they are more powerful and easier to use.|The Template Driven approach is very familiar to AngularJs developers and is ideal for easy migration of AngularJs applications into Angular.|
|The Reactive approach removes validation logic from the template, keeping the templates cleaner.||
|Reactive forms are easier to use in general and support better more advanced use cases via its Observable-based API.||
