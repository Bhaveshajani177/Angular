## Difference Between Relative Path Vs Absoulute Path

| Absoulute Path | Relative Path |
|----------------| ---------------- |
| The path with reference to root directory is called absolute.  | The path with reference to current directory is called relative. |
| An absolute path always contains the root element and the complete directory list required to locate the file. | A relative path needs to be combined with another path in order to access a file. |
| Example: <br /> 1} src="http://www.foo.com/images/kitten.png" <br /> 2} D:\documents\something.doc <br /> 3} E:\music\good_music.mp3 | Example: <br /> 1} src="kitten.png" <br /> 2} .\image.png <br /> 3} ./image.png <br /> |
