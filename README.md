# Notes:

### platformBrowserDynamic:
- platformBrowserDynamic is a function used to bootstrap an Angular application.
- contains the client side code that processes templates (bindings, components, ...) and reflective dependency injection.
- Using the dynamic platform makes angular sending the Just-in-Time compiler to the front-end as well as your application. Which means your application is being compiled on client-side.

### polyfills:
- Angular is built on the latest standards of the web platform. Targeting such a wide range of browsers is challenging because they do not support all features of modern browsers. You compensate by loading polyfill scripts ("polyfills") for the browsers that you must support.

### Interpolation "{{}}":
- Text interpolation lets you incorporate dynamic string values into your HTML templates.
- Use interpolation to dynamically change what appears in an application view.

### Just-in-Time:
- Larger file size
- Loads slower since compiler needs to run in browser.
- Catch errors in browser

### Ahead-of-Time:
- Small file size
- Loads faster since the app is compiled on delivery to the browser.
- Catch errors on the server

### TypeScript:
- Typescript is a Javascript superset.
- It offers more features than Javascript like classes, interfaces, types.
- Uses strong typing(you define if something is a string, number etc).
- TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.
- TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs.
- Advantages of TypeScript:
  - **Strict typing**
  - **Type annotations:** A handy way of saying explicitly what type should be used.
  - **Type inference:** Implicit typing performed by TypeScript itself, so that your developers donâ€™t need to provide types where the compiler can find them on its own.
  - **Types make code management easier**

# Important Points:
- ng serve -> call ```environment.ts file``` -> production: false
- ng build	-> call ```environment.prod.ts``` -> production: true
- main.ts -> entry point
- first priority is ```templateUrl``` rather than ```template```.
- first priority is ```styles``` rather than ```styleUrls```.
- ```npm start``` == ```ng serve```
- Use brackets [] instead of new Array().
- Use curly braces {} instead of new Object().
- ```|``` = Pipe character
- ```?``` = optional parameter
- Prefix ```ng``` stands for ```Angular```
