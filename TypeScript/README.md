### TypeScript:
- Typescript is a Javascript superset.
- It offers more features than Javascript like classes, interfaces, types.
- Uses strong typing(you define if something is a string, number etc).
- TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.
- TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs.
- Advantages of TypeScript:
  - **Strict typing**
  - **Type annotations:** A handy way of saying explicitly what type should be used.
  - **Type inference:** Implicit typing performed by TypeScript itself, so that your developers donâ€™t need to provide types where the compiler can find them on its own.
  - **Types make code management easier**
